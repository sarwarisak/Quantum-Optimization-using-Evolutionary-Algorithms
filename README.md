# Quantum Optimization using Evolutionary Algorithms
Use of evolutionary algorithm to minimize the cost function so as to estimate the ground state for a model. The evolutionary algorithm part involves inserting/deleting/modifying quantum gates at random locations in the quantum circuit.

The notebook with relevant working code is "Project.ipynb" present in this repo. It can also be viewed at this url : https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sarwarisak/Quantum-Optimization-using-Evolutionary-Algorithms/blob/main/Project.ipynb
